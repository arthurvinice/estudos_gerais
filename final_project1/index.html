            <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815â€“1852), was an English mathematician and writer. She is
                chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the
                Analytical
                Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is now considered to be the first algorithm intended for
                implementation on a machine.</p>
            <p>Ada's collaboration with Charles Babbage laid the groundwork for her famous notes, where she described an
                algorithm for the engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. This is now considered the first computer
                program.</p>
            <p>Ada Lovelace's work was largely forgotten for many years, but she is now recognized as a pioneer of
                computer science. The programming language Ada was named in her honor.</p>

            <p>Ada Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England. She showed an early aptitude for
                mathematics, influenced by her mother's insistence on a scientific education.</p>
